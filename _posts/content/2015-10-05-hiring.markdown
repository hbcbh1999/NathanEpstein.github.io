### Types of Errors

"In statistical hypothesis testing, a type I error is the incorrect rejection of a true null hypothesis (a 'false positive'), while a type II error is the failure to reject a false null hypothesis (a 'false negative')."

Given the disastrous consequences of a single bad early hire (at a startup), the null hypothesis in the context of hiring decisions (at a startup) should be that a candidate is not strong enough to warrant an offer. Incorrectly accepting this hypothesis, and letting a good candidate go, is bad. Incorrectly rejecting, and making a bad hire, is worse.

This turns out to be closely related to the idea, promoted by Ben Horowitz, that you should hire for strength rather than for lack of weakness. In evaluating a candidate, the basic test should be 'have I been sufficiently impressed as to reject my initial assumption?' rather than 'has the candidate avoided obvious missteps in demonstrating baseline knowledge?'. A middling candidate can pass the second test (particularly if your default mindset to is to make a hire) while they are very unlikely to pass the first.

### Practical Takeaways

1) In evaluating a candidate, you should only say yes with strong conviction. If you're unsure, the answer is probably no.

2) When interviewers meet to make a hiring decision, start with a vote. A candidate should meet a target approval rating (more on this below) if they're to be seriously considered.

This serves to reduce the chance of making an erroneous hire. The probability of many people independently voting yes on a bad hire is lower than that of a similar consensus occurring within a persuasive voting block.

This is not to say that no discussion should happen. If the initial vote is positive, it's good to reaffirm that everyone's reasoning makes sense. Alternatively, a strong candidate can have an off performance in some subset of the interview process without warranting rejection. However, a discussion which leads to an affirmative decision on a candidate who did not receive a warm initial reaction should be viewed with suspicion.

To use the optimization jargon, we're minimizing the probability of hiring a bad candidate subject to the constraint that we don't reject candidates that meet a certain quality bar (unanimous approval of all interviewers is a good one to shoot for but this can be relaxed if interviewers are sufficiently plentiful or hard to impress<sup>**</sup>). Obviously, without such a constraint, we can guarantee we never make a bad hire by never making any hires at all.

This process has the additional benefit of keeping meetings about new hires short. Lingering debates can generally be cut off; if you get to an affirmative decision, you're likely to get there quickly.

** It may also be tempting to relax this standard to meet high hiring demand. It's possible to imagine scenarios where this is appropriate but generally, the right course of action is to focus on increasing the top of the hiring funnel (i.e. identify more candidates) rather than loosening hiring standards (see the second reference for more on this).
