I am software engineer and data scientist living in New York City. I sporadically participate in open source software development (primarily machine learning and data visualization tools). I studied applied math (probability and optimization) at Columbia University.

I occasionally write things (sometimes in journals, usually not) about math, startups, and economics. I've given talks at EmpireNode, QueensJS, and various other meetups. I've done volunteer work teaching code with ScriptEd. My Erdos number is 7.
