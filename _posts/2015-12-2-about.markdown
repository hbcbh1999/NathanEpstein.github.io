I am software engineer and data scientist living in New York City. I sporadically participate in open source software development (primarily machine learning and data visualization tools). I studied applied math (probability and optimization) at Columbia University.

I've published academic research and other writing related to math, startups, and economics. I've given talks at EmpireNode, QueensJS, and various other meetups. I've done volunteer work teaching code with ScriptEd. My Erdos number is 7.
