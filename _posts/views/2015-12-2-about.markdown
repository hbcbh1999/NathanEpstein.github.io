I am a software engineer and data scientist living in New York City. I currently work at [Bloomberg](https://bloomberg.com). I sporadically participate in open source software development (primarily machine learning and data visualization tools). I studied applied math and code at [Columbia University](http://www.columbia.edu/) and [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/).

I occasionally write things (sometimes in journals, usually not) about math, startups, and finance. I've given talks at [PyData](http://pydata.org/), [EmpireNode](http://empirenode.org), and various other conferences. I've done volunteer work teaching code with [ScriptEd](https://www.scripted.org/). My [Erd≈ës number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) is 7.
